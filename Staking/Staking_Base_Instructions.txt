Before the user can interact with the contract and stake their nfts, they first need to approve the contract.
Your nft contract should have an approveAll function where the user can input the 1.staking contract address and 2. a bool ( true / false )

Write Contract functions

1. claim - input array of tokenIds to claim staking rewards ( ex. [25,34,82] )
2. claimForAddress - input address and array of tokeIds they hold to claim the tokens for them ( ex. 0x00.. , [25,34,82] )
3* pause - pauses the contract so no new tokens can be staked. 
4* removeRewardTokens - removes an amount of reward tokens from the contract. ( ex. 25000000000000000000 .This removes 25 tokens )
5* renounceOwnership - sets the owner of the contract to the 0 address and can no longer be changed or owned by anyone. Dont do this unless you know what you are doing.
6* setMaxWithdrawPercentageOfContract - sets the maximum % a single nft can withdraw from the staking contract. 100% = 1000000 ( ex. 1000 sets the max withdraw to 0.1% of the total contract wallet )
7* setReward - sets the daily reward per nft ( ex. 100 sets the reward to 100 tokens per day )
8. stake - input an array of tokenIds to stake them. The user must first approve the contract to use their nfts before they can stake ( ex. [25,34,82] )
9. transferOwnership - input an address you want to make the new owner of the contract ( ex. 0x00... )
10* unpause - if the contract is paused, this will unpause it.
11. unstake - input an array of tokenIds to unstake them. This will also send the accumulated rewards ( ex. [25,34,82] )
* - Only Owner of the contract can run this function.

Read Contract functions

1. balanceOf - returns the number of nfts an address has staked.
2. contractRewardBalance - shows the amount of reward tokens the contract holds.
3. earningInfo - returns the rewards earned for the address and the tokenId input ( ex. 0x00... , [25,34,82] returns 102 tokens earned)
4. maxWithdrawPercentageOfContract - shows current maximum withdraw percentage with denomonator of 1000000 ( ex. 1000 = 0.1%)
5. onERC721Received - no idea lol
6. owner - shows the current owner of the contract.
7. paused - shows if the contract is paused or not.
8. rewardRate - returns the current daily reward per nft.
9. tokensOfOwner - returns all the tokenIds an address currently has staked.
10. totalStaked - total number of nfts staked in the contract.
11. vault - returns tokenId, time an nft was staked, and the owner of the token.
